# Node.js Image Upload with Cloudinary Backup: Ensuring Data Integrity and Availability"

where users can upload images. To ensure data integrity and availability, I'm implementing a strategy where uploaded images are initially stored in a temporary folder (public/temp) on the server. This step acts as a safety net in case a user loses their internet connection during the upload process.

Once the images are safely stored in the temporary folder on the server, they are then asynchronously uploaded to Cloudinary for permanent storage. Cloudinary serves as our cloud storage solution, providing scalability and reliability for hosting these images.

This approach helps mitigate potential data loss or interruptions caused by network issues, ensuring a seamless experience for users when uploading their images."

# Process

In Node.js, the process object is a global object provided by the Node.js runtime environment. It provides information and control over the current Node.js process. Some of the commonly used properties and methods of the process

# "Managing Cookies in Express: Simplified CRUD Operations"

1.Accessing Cookies from Server: You can read cookies sent by the user's browser.

2.Setting Cookies from Server: You can send new or updated cookies back to the browser.

3.CRUD Operations on Cookies: You can create, read, update, or delete cookies from the server.

4.Secure Cookies: You can make cookies secure so only the server can access or delete them.

# Stack trace

Stack traces in JavaScript provide critical insights into program errors. They show the sequence of function calls leading to an error, with the topmost frame indicating the error location. Each frame includes context like function names and line numbers. Understanding stack traces is essential for debugging and pinpointing issues accurately, aiding in the resolution of errors effectively.

# plugins

In the context of Mongoose, a plugin is a reusable piece of Mongoose schema middleware that adds additional functionality to your Mongoose models.

# Cryptography

bcrypt ensures robust password storage by hashing passwords, while jsonwebtoken provides secure token-based authentication and data exchange in web applications, bolstering overall system security.

# Mongoose hooks

Mongoose hooks are functions that allow you to execute custom code at specific points in the lifecycle of a Mongoose model. These hooks enable you to perform actions such as validation, modification, or logging before or after certain operations on the model, such as saving, updating, or removing documents.

# Bearer Token

Bearer Token JWT is a JWT used as an access token in token-based authentication schemes, where the token is included in the Authorization header of HTTP requests to authenticate users.

# schema.methods

In Mongoose, schema.methods is a property that allows you to add custom instance methods to your Mongoose model. Instance methods are methods that are available on individual documents created from your model. These methods are useful for performing operations specific to individual documents, such as manipulating data, performing calculations, or interacting with related documents.
