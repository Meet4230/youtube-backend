# Node.js Image Upload with Cloudinary Backup: Ensuring Data Integrity and Availability"

where users can upload images. To ensure data integrity and availability, I'm implementing a strategy where uploaded images are initially stored in a temporary folder (public/temp) on the server. This step acts as a safety net in case a user loses their internet connection during the upload process.

Once the images are safely stored in the temporary folder on the server, they are then asynchronously uploaded to Cloudinary for permanent storage. Cloudinary serves as our cloud storage solution, providing scalability and reliability for hosting these images.

This approach helps mitigate potential data loss or interruptions caused by network issues, ensuring a seamless experience for users when uploading their images."
